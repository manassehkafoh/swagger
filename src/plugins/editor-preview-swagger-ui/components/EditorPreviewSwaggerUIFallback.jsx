          <p>
            It is in the SwaggerUI roadmap to fully support rendering of OpenAPI 3.1 definitions.
            For additional information, please refer to this Github{' '}

          <p>
            However, SwaggerEditor itself does support OpenAPI 3.1 within its editing experience.
            This includes OpenAPI 3.1 validation rules and semantic highlighting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, you may continue to write and update your OpenAPI 3.1 definitions with confidence
            in conformance to the OpenAPI 3.1 specification.
