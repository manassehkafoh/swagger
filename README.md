# Swagger Editor

Swagger Editor lets you edit API specifications in YAML inside your browser and to preview documentations in real time.
Valid Swagger JSON descriptions can then be generated and used with the full Swagger tooling (code generation, documentation, etc).

To understand how it works, you should [try the live demo](http://wordnik.github.io/swagger-editor)!

## YAML Syntax
YAML became a first-class citizen as part of the Swagger 2.0 working group process. Documenation for the YAML syntax will become part of the documentation of the [Swagger 2.0 spec](https://github.com/reverb/swagger-spec).

## Tips
You can import an existing YAML spec by using the `import` query parameter. For example:
```
http://editor.swagger.wordnik.com/?import=http://generator.wordnik.com/online/api/swagger.yaml
```

## Running Locally

#### Install required dependencies on your machine

Make sure you have all dependencies

```shell
node --version
bower --version
grunt --version
```
If you don't have any of the dependencies, install them from their websites:

 * [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)
 * [Bower](http://bower.io/)
 * [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
 

#### Clone the repository and install packages

```shell
git clone git@github.com:wordnik/swagger-editor.git
cd swagger-editor
npm install
bower install
grunt serve
```

This will open a browser window running current development version.

#### Configuration

See [./docs/config.rst](./docs/config.rst)


### Run with Docker

If you are familiar with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), a `Dockerfile` is
provided.

Build an image named `swagger-editor`
```
sudo docker build -t swagger-editor .
```

Run the container, using the local port 8080 (you may change this to any available
port).
```
sudo docker run -ti -p 8080:9000 swagger-editor
```
And open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser


## Building and publishing

#### Building
To build the project just run: 

```
$ grunt build
```
This will build a new version of the web app, ready for production in `/dist` folder

#### Pushing to `gh-page`

To copy everything in `/dist` folder to `gh-pages` branch and push it to github, just run:

```
$ grunt ship
```
Please do not touch `gh-pages` branch manually!
