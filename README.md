# Swagger Editor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/swagger-api/swagger-editor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/swagger-api/swagger-editor)
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/swagger-api/swagger-editor/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/swagger-api/swagger-editor)

Swagger Editor lets you edit API specifications in YAML inside your browser and to preview documentations in real time.
Valid Swagger JSON descriptions can then be generated and used with the full Swagger tooling (code generation, documentation, etc).

To understand how it works, you should [try the live demo](http://editor.swagger.io/#/edit)!

## YAML Syntax
YAML became a first-class citizen as part of the Swagger 2.0 working group process. Documentation for the YAML syntax will become part of the documentation of the [Swagger 2.0 spec](https://github.com/reverb/swagger-spec).

## Tips
You can import an existing YAML spec by using the `import` query parameter in edit mode. For example:
```
http://editor.swagger.io/#/edit?import=http://generator.wordnik.com/online/api/swagger.yaml
```

## Running Locally

This project was tested with Node.js version `0.10`. Make sure you have at least this version.

```shell
node --version
```

#### Clone the repository and start it

```shell
git clone git@github.com:swagger-api/swagger-editor.git
cd swagger-editor
```

##### Start on Mac and Linux
```shell
npm start
```

##### Start on Windows
```shell
npm install -g bower grunt-cli
npm install
bower install
grunt serve
```

This will open a browser window running current development version.

## Development

For development it's preferred to have `grunt` installed globally on your machine.  

### Building
To build the project just run: 

```
$ grunt build
```
This will build a new version of the web app, ready for production in `/dist` folder

### Pushing to `gh-page`

To copy everything in `/dist` folder to `gh-pages` branch and push it to github, just run:

```
$ grunt ship
```
Please do not touch `gh-pages` branch manually!

###  Configuration
See [./docs/config.rst](./docs/config.rst) and [./app/scripts/enums/defaults.js](./app/scripts/enums/defaults.js)
